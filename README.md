The task was to implement a parallelized application leveraging the University of Melbourne HPC facility SPARTAN. Your application will process a large Twitter dataset. 
The objective is to identify the:
• happiest hour ever in the data,
• happiest day ever in the data,
• most active hour ever, i.e. the hour that had the most posts in the data,
• most active day ever, i.e. which day had the most posts in the data.

The program should allow a given number of nodes and cores to be utilized. Specifically, the program should be run once to search the largest JSON file on each of the following resources:
• 1 node and 1 core;
• 1 node and 8 cores;
• 2 nodes and 8 cores (with 4 cores per node).
